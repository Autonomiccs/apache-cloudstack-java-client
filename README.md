# apache-cloudstack-java-client

This project facilitates the integration of Java applications with Apache CloudStack through its API. It is a Java framework that enables the execution of requests to Apache CloudStack API. If you want to write only a simple script I recommend you using <a href="https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey">CloudMonkey</a>, instead of this framework. However, if you have the need to write a Java application that has to consume Apache CloudStack API, you are welcome to use this framework.
 
You can find examples on how to use the framework at <a href="https://github.com/Autonomiccs/apache-cloudstack-java-client/tree/master/samples/apache-cloudstack-client-examples">examples</a>. The usage is as simple as that:

```java

        String secretKey = "<secretKey>";
        String apiKey = "<apiKey>";
        String cloudStackUrl = "https://cloud.domain.com/client/api";

        ApacheCloudStackUser apacheCloudStackUser = new ApacheCloudStackUser(secretKey, apiKey);
        ApacheCloudStackClient apacheCloudStackClient = new ApacheCloudStackClient(cloudStackUrl, apacheCloudStackUser);

        ApacheCloudStackRequest apacheCloudStackRequest = new ApacheCloudStackRequest("listClusters");
        apacheCloudStackRequest.addParameter("response", "json");
        apacheCloudStackRequest.addParameter("name", "clusterName");

        String response = apacheCloudStackClient.executeRequest(apacheCloudStackRequest);
        System.out.println(response);
```

The component is on Maven central repo; to use it, you only need to add the following piece of code to your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>br.com.autonomiccs</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache-cloudstack-java-client</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.8</version>
</dependency>
```
